This project is a simple web page built using ReactJS with the three essential components: Navbar Section, Heroic Section, and Card Section. 
It uses CDN links to load React and ReactDOM libraries and includes a basic CSS file for styling.

## Project Components

### Navbar Component

The Navbar component provides a navigation menu for easy user interaction. It contains navigation links such as Home, About, Services, and Contact.

### Heroic Section Component

The Heroic Section is a visually striking area at the top of the page designed to capture the user's attention and provide a brief introduction to the page's content.

### Card Section Component

The Card Section displays a set of cards, each containing an icon and content. 
You can customize these cards to showcase various types of data, such as products, services, or articles.
